    "#### 1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Boolean (sometimes shortened to Bool) is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.\n",
    "syntax: True and False (first letter must be captail).\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- AND, OR, NOT are three basic and fundamental boolean operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate .\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- =(Assignment operator) is used for assigning the value to variable ,while ==(Equal to operator) is used to equate two variables or numbers, if it is true results True and False if results false.\n",

    "Exapmle- x = 3+4 i.e. assigning x=7 and if x==7(check whether x=7 or no) then it would results in True.\n",

    "Ans- ctrl + C -----> to terminate enless loop in terminal and click on interrupt kernel for jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- 'break' is a reserved keyword used for discontinuing the ongoing loop or in other words stop the loop in which that statement is placed and 'continue' is also reserved keyword used to skip the iteration/code below of it and go on to next execution of loop/iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- In for loop, range(10), range(0,10), range(0,10,1) all are same it all generate numbers 0 to 9 with step-size as 1.\n",
    "syntax: range(ini_pt_, final_pt_, step_size), so by default initial_pt = 0 and step_size = 1 \n",
